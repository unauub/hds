Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Hello Mr. You!**
Hope you're doing well in this *jupyter notebook* i've try to make a prediction model or machine learning model that can help as to classify if a person has ****heart disease or not****.

And the big thing about this is i've try more and more to make it look as a **Course where, it'll take you step by step from getting data and end with evaluation your model.

Here's it the walkthrough, maybe it looks smaller but all you need is already written in the jupyter notebook:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation


### *Problem definition*
Our role here is to build a machine learning model, where it can predict for a clinical if their patients have heart disease or not !!?

### *Data*
So, here to get your data you have 2 choices, both we'll give you the same dataset but for me i've choose kaggle b'coz it give it to me in CSV Format.
* For Kaggle: Click [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/heart-disease-uci/data)
* For UCI: Click [Here](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)

### *Evaluation*
our goal is: get **95%** in the accuracy test, Unfortunately we didn't get it coz lack of Data

### *Features*
We've worked on a dictionary and the meaning of every feature, i know maybe we are not specialist in Medicine but we did it

### *Modelling*
In this step we've start we 3 model:
* KNN Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier

But we've found that ****LogisticRegression**** give us the best result
